# DrawingProject
The Drawing Panel project is an application that allows users to draw on a panel using different shapes such as lines, ovals, and rectangles. Users can change the colors of the drawn shapes and clear the panel to start over. This project aims to provide an interactive experience for users and develop their skills in using graphical user interfaces (GUI) in Java.
